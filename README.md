# 🐣 Tweeter Project 🐣

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone! 

It has a header with the HTML markup for profile information, a feed with some pre-loaded tweets and a text field for you to enter your own tweets. The tweets generated will post under a randomized profile ID and avatar. The feed then updates with your new content in real time. There is a character counter affixed to the text field that will show you how many characters you have left before you reach the limit. It checks for errors in submitted content, and error messages are displayed directly underneath the text field. Responsive displays for tablets and mobile devices.
